# Pomodoro Timer

A simple Pomodoro Timer application built with Python and Tkinter.

## Description

This Pomodoro Timer is a productivity tool that helps users manage their work and break sessions. It follows the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. The technique uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Features

- 25-minute work sessions
- 5-minute short breaks
- 20-minute long breaks after every 4 work sessions
- Visual timer display
- Start and reset functionality
- Check marks to track completed work sessions

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter

## How It Works

1. The timer alternates between work sessions and breaks.
2. After every 4 work sessions, a long break is triggered.
3. Check marks appear at the bottom to track completed work sessions.
4. The timer resets after 4 full cycles (4 work sessions + 4 breaks).
